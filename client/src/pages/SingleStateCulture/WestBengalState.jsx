        stateHistory="
West Bengal, located in eastern India, has a rich history shaped by its ancient civilizations, including the Mauryan and Gupta empires. In the medieval period, it was ruled by the Bengal Sultanate and became a major center for trade and culture. Under British colonial rule, Kolkata became the capital of British India, and the region saw the rise of the Bengali Renaissance, with figures like Rabindranath Tagore leading social and cultural reforms. After Indiaâ€™s independence in 1947, Bengal was divided into West Bengal and East Bengal (now Bangladesh), leading to significant migration and tensions. Post-independence, West Bengal experienced political shifts, including the long rule of the Communist Party, and has evolved into a hub for culture, arts, and economic growth."
