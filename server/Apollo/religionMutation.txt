  "overview": "Hinduism is one of the world's oldest and most diverse religions, characterized by a rich tapestry of beliefs, rituals, and philosophies. It is the predominant religion in India and Nepal and has millions of followers worldwide. Hinduism is not a monolithic religion but a complex, pluralistic tradition with numerous deities, practices, and schools of thought.",
  "history": "Hinduism's origins trace back over 4,000 years to the ancient Indus Valley Civilization and the Vedic period (1500-500 BCE). The Vedas, a collection of sacred texts, are among the earliest religious writings in Hinduism. Over centuries, Hinduism evolved through various philosophical and devotional movements, including the Upanishads, which introduced the concepts of karma and moksha (liberation). The epics, Mahabharata and Ramayana, and the Puranas further shaped Hindu beliefs and practices. The emergence of devotional (bhakti) movements between the 7th and 12th centuries CE emphasized personal devotion to deities such as Vishnu, Shiva, and Shakti, leading to a rich tradition of temple worship and pilgrimage.",
  "regions": "Hinduism is primarily practiced in India, where it influences daily life, culture, and politics. It also has significant communities in Nepal, Bangladesh, Sri Lanka, and among the Indian diaspora worldwide. Temples and festivals related to Hinduism are prominent in countries with large Indian communities, including the United States, Canada, and the United Kingdom.",
