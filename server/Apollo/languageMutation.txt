  "description": "Sanskrit, one of the oldest languages in the world, has been a crucial part of South Asian culture and spirituality for thousands of years. It originated around 1500 BCE with the composition of the Vedas, the earliest sacred texts of Hinduism. Over time, it evolved through various stages, including the Upanishads, which introduced philosophical and metaphysical concepts, and the epics such as the Mahabharata and Ramayana. These texts not only narrate epic tales but also convey moral and philosophical teachings. Sanskrit's influence extends to classical literature, including plays and poetry, making it a cornerstone of ancient Indian intellectual and spiritual traditions.",
